title: "Jennifer McHenry"
description: "I am a quantitive geographer interested in a range of interdisciplinary
  questions related to the macroecology, global change, and ecosystem services provided
  by coastal marine ecosystems. My research is motivated by the dual goal of advancing
  ecological theory and informing spatial managment decisions, related to habitat
  consevation and restoration. Currently, I am completng a PhD in geography in the
  \ Rasster Lab (the joint labs of [Dr. Sarah E. Lester](www.lester-lab.org) and [Dr.
  Andrew Rassweiler](www.rassweiler-lab.org) at [Florida State University](www.geography.fsu.edu)).
  My work combines novel field and laboratory approaches, data synthesis, modeling,
  and geographic information systems (GIS). Scientific collaboration, partnerships
  with marine stakeholders, and mentorship of undergraduate trainees are all important
  facets of my work. \n"
