## About Me

I am a quantitative marine ecologist with interests at the intersection of ecology, society, climate change, policy, and natural resource management. My research seeks to understand the consequences of climate change and marine management decisions for the structure, ecological function, and ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems, including seagrasses and temperate reefs. An emerging direction of my research also seeks to understand how better management of coastal ecosystems can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. I combine novel field and lab approaches, geospatial analyses, open data synthesis, and forecast modeling. Scientific collaboration, partnerships with marine stakeholders, and mentorship of undergraduate trainees are also important facets of my work. 


Currently, I am an Ocean Climate Solutions postdoctoral fellow in the [Baum Lab](https://www.juliakbaum.org/) at the University of Victoria (UVic) working on a multi-institute collaboration called the [Blue Carbon Canada project](www.BlueCarbonCanada.ca). Previously, I completed a PhD in geography in the Rasster Lab (the joint labs of [Dr. Sarah E. Lester](www.lester-lab.org) and [Dr. Andrew Rassweiler](www.rassweiler-lab.org) at [Florida State University](www.geography.fsu.edu)).
