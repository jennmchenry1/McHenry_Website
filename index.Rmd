## Bio

I am a quantitative geographer interested in a range of interdisciplinary research questions related to the macroecology, global change, and ecosystem services provided by coastal marine ecosystems. My research is motivated by the dual goal of advancing ecological theory and informing spatial management decisions, related to habitat conservation and restoration, ocean planning, and sustainable fisheries. Currently, I am completing a PhD in geography in the Rasster Lab (the joint labs of [Dr. Sarah E. Lester](www.lester-lab.org) and [Dr. Andrew Rassweiler](www.rassweiler-lab.org) at [Florida State University](www.geography.fsu.edu)). My work combines novel field and laboratory approaches, data synthesis, modeling, and geographic information systems (GIS). Scientific collaboration, partnerships with marine stakeholders, and mentorship of undergraduate trainees are all important facets of my work.
