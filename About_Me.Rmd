## About Me

I am a quantitative marine ecologist with research interests at the intersection of ecology, environmental change, society, and natural resource management. I combine novel field and lab approaches, spatial analyses, data synthesis, and statistical modeling to answer basic and applied questions about the changing structure, function, and societal benefits of coastal ecosystems that feature marine foundation species (e.g., seagrasses and kelp forests). Broadly, my research seeks to understand the consequences of intensifying climate changes and natural resource management decisions for nature and people. An emerging direction of my research also seeks to understand how better management of coastal ecosystems can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. 

I am most excited about solutions-oriented research, involving multidisciplinary collaborations and team science approaches (e.g., working groups). Currently I am on the leadership committee for the [Subtidal Kelp & Kelp Ecosystem Service Working Group](https://kelpnode.org/working-groups/subtidal-kelp-ecosystem-services) for the British Columbia - Washington Kelp Node. Additionally, I am co-leading and co-organizing the new "Northwest Atlantic Kelp on the Move Working Group" with [Dr. Kira Krumhansl](https://kirakrumhansl.com/about/) from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography. 

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring to prepare students for future careers as modern scientists, policymakers, and professionals. If you are interested in getting involved in my research, please reach out!

Finally, I am committed to fostering diverse, equitable, and inclusive research and learning environments in higher education. 


## Affiliation
I am an Ocean Climate Solutions postdoctoral fellow in the [Baum Lab](https://www.juliakbaum.org/) at the University of Victoria (UVic) working on a multi-institute collaboration called the [Blue Carbon Canada project](www.BlueCarbonCanada.ca). Previously, I completed a dual MSc in marine biology and policy at the University of  Maine's Darling Marine Center supervised by Dr. Bob Steneck, followed by a PhD in geography at Florida State University) supervised by [Dr. Sarah E. Lester](www.lester-lab.org). In between my MSc degrees and PhD, I worked as an affiliated researcher with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northeast Fisheries Science Center based at the [J.J. Howard Marine Lab](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/james-j-howard-marine-sciences-laboratory-sandy-hook) in Sandy Hook, NJ. Subsequently, I was as a lab manager and research technician with the Rasster Lab (the joint labs of Dr. Sarah Lester and [Dr. Andrew Rassweiler](www.rassweiler-lab.org) at FSU.
