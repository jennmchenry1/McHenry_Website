## About Me

I am a quantitative marine ecologist with research interests at the intersection of ecology, environmental change, society, and marine management. I combine novel field and lab approaches, geospatial analyses, open data synthesis, and forecast modeling to answer basic and applied questions about the changing structure, function, and ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems, including seagrasses and temperate reefs. Broadly, my research seeks to understand the consequences of intensifying climate changes and spatial management decisions for nature and people. An emerging direction of my research also seeks to understand how better management of coastal ecosystems can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. 

I am most excited about solutions-oriented research, involving multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships with marine stakeholders. Much of my work involves researchers and management practitioners from government agencies (e.g., NOAA, DFO) and eNGOs.

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring to prepare students for future careers as modern scientists, policymakers, and professionals. If you are interested in getting involved in my research, please research out!

Finally, I am committed to fostering diverse, equitable, and inclusive research and learning environments in higher education. 


## Affiliation
I am an Ocean Climate Solutions postdoctoral fellow in the [Baum Lab](https://www.juliakbaum.org/) at the University of Victoria (UVic) working on a multi-institute collaboration called the [Blue Carbon Canada project](www.BlueCarbonCanada.ca). Previously, I completed a PhD in geography in the Rasster Lab (the joint labs of [Dr. Sarah E. Lester](www.lester-lab.org) and [Dr. Andrew Rassweiler](www.rassweiler-lab.org) at [Florida State University](www.geography.fsu.edu)).
