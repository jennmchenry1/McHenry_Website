### Biogeographical & ecological effects of ocean climate change

The first major theme of my research addresses the biogeographical and ecological effects of ocean climate change on coastal and marine ecosystems. My research examines the effects of gradual climate changes (e.g., such as ocean warming and sea-level rise) on the geographic distributions of coastal marine species. Increasingly, I also consider the effects of extreme climatic events (e.g., marine heatwaves) on coastal ecosystems and how climate-driven redistribution of marine foundation species (e.g., seagrass beds and kelp forests) could impact coastal ecosystem functions. For this work I tend to integrate statistical models, spatial analysis, and data synthesis approaches with observational data, ocean-climate forecasts, and high-performance computing.

### Coastal management scenarios to achieve ecological & societal co-benefits

The second major theme of my research concerns the diverse ecosystem services (ES) provided by coastal environments with foundation species. My research examines the biophysical drivers underpinning ES delivery and uses scenario modeling approaches to quantify the potential co-benefits of marine conservation and restoration decisions. Increasingly my research also explores how spatial planning and prioritization approaches can help to promote sustainable and equitable access to marine ecosystem services under climate change.

### Oceans as natural climate solutions

An emerging theme of my research addresses the potential for blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) to contribute natural climate solutions (NCS). Foundation habitats, such as seagrass beds, tidal marshes, and potentially kelp forests, are thought to play a globally significant role as natural reservoirs for organic and inorganic carbon. However, there is still considerable uncertainty in their estimated extents and relative rates of carbon accumulation. My research seeks to resolve these uncertainties and critically evaluate whether BCEs could provide viable climate mitigation pathways through their expanded conservation and restoration.
