My research seeks to understand the consequences of climate change and marine management decisions for the structure, ecological function, and ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems, including seagrasses and temperate reefs. An emerging direction of my research also seeks to understand how better management of coastal ecosystems can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. I combine novel field and lab approaches, geospatial analyses, open data synthesis, and forecast modeling.\r\n            I am most excited about applied and solutions-oriented research, involving scientific collaborations and partnerships with marine stakeholders. Much of my previous work has involved researchers and management practitioners from government agencies (e.g., NOAA, DFO) and eNGOs.\r\n            I am passionate about teaching and mentoring to prepare students for future careers as modern scientists, policymakers, and professionals. If you are interested in getting involved in my research, please research out!\r\n            Finally, I am committed to fostering diverse, equitable, and inclusive research and learning environments in higher education.\r\n            Currently, I am an Ocean Climate Solutions postdoctoral fellow in the Baum Lab at the University of Victoria (UVic) working on a multi-institute collaboration called the Blue Carbon Canada project. Previously, I completed a PhD in geography in the Rasster Lab (the joint labs of Dr. Sarah E.

During my PhD, I examined the need to account for multiple environmental variables when projecting marine species range shifts in response to ocean warming. I also examined the potential for climate change to disrupt key ecological interactions, like the critical role that tropical seagrass beds play in enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nMarine Ecosystem Service Delivery in a Changing World\r\nThe second major theme of my research seeks to understand and predict the ecosystem service outcomes of habitat conservation and restoration decisions. My dissertation research examined the capacity of seagrasses in the Florida Gulf Coast to provide multiple ecosystem services, evaluating spatial patterns of service co-variation and exploring the potential for co-benefits and trade-offs from management.\r\n\r\nOcean Climate Solutions\r\nAn emerging theme of my research seeks to evaluate how blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) can contribute to the development of ocean climate solutions. As part of a new multi-institute collaboration (Blue Carbon Canada), my postdoc research will address critical research gaps concerning the current and future mitigation potential of Canada’s BCEs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The course covers topics ranging from the GIS software and spatial data structures to the cartographic principles for mapping, metadata creation, and a variety of spatial analyses. Students also gain hands-on experience with applying concepts and tools introduces in the lectures using ArcGIS Pro.\r\nBiogeography (GEO4300) - Florida State University, Department of Geography - Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant\r\nThis is an undergraduate course focused on the distributions (including past, present, and increasingly, future distributions) of species and ecosystems across space and over time. The course is a lecture and topical reading-based course providing students with a foundation in biogeography, and also in various biogeographical concepts as they apply to contemporary issues such as land management, invasive species, and species conservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
