I combine novel\r\n            field and lab approaches, spatial analyses, data synthesis,\r\n            and statistical modeling to answer basic and applied\r\n            questions about the changing structure, function, and\r\n            ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems, including\r\n            seagrasses, kelp forests, and tidal marshes. Broadly, my\r\n            research seeks to understand the consequences of\r\n            intensifying climate changes and natural resource management\r\n            for nature and people. An emerging direction of my research\r\n            also seeks to understand how better management of coastal\r\n            ecosystems can contribute to climate mitigation and\r\n            adaptation efforts.\r\n            I am most excited about solutions-oriented research,\r\n            involving multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships\r\n            with marine stakeholders. Much of my work involves\r\n            researchers and management practitioners from government\r\n            agencies (e.g., NOAA, DFO) and eNGOs.\r\n            I am passionate about teaching and mentoring to prepare\r\n            students for future careers as modern scientists,\r\n            policymakers, and professionals. If you are interested in\r\n            getting involved in my research, please research out!\r\n            Finally, I am committed to fostering diverse, equitable,\r\n            and inclusive research and learning environments in higher\r\n            education.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Affiliation\r\n            I am an Ocean Climate Solutions postdoctoral fellow in\r\n            the Baum Lab at\r\n            the University of Victoria (UVic) working on a\r\n            multi-institute collaboration called the Blue Carbon Canada\r\n            project.

      "contents": "\r\nBiogeographical & ecological effects of ocean climate change\r\nThe first major theme of my research addresses the biogeographical and ecological effects of ocean climate change on coastal and marine ecosystems. My research examines the effects of gradual climate changes (e.g., such as ocean warming and sea-level rise) on the geographic distributions of coastal marine species. Increasingly, I also consider the effects of extreme climatic events (e.g., marine heatwaves) on coastal ecosystems and how climate-driven redistribution of marine foundation species (e.g., seagrass beds and kelp forests) could impact coastal ecosystem functions. For this work I tend to integrate statistical models, spatial analysis, and data synthesis approaches with observational data, ocean-climate forecasts, and high-performance computing.\r\n\r\nCoastal management scenarios to achieve ecological & societal co-benefits\r\nThe second major theme of my research concerns the diverse ecosystem services (ES) provided by coastal environments with foundation species. My research examines the biophysical drivers underpinning ES delivery and uses scenario modeling approaches to quantify the potential co-benefits of marine conservation and restoration decisions. Increasingly my research also explores how spatial planning and prioritization approaches can help to promote sustainable and equitable access to marine ecosystem services under climate change.\r\n\r\nOceans as natural climate solutions\r\nAn emerging theme of my research addresses the potential for blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) to contribute natural climate solutions (NCS). Foundation habitats, such as seagrass beds, tidal marshes, and potentially kelp forests, are thought to play a globally significant role as natural reservoirs for organic and inorganic carbon. However, there is still considerable uncertainty in their estimated extents and relative rates of carbon accumulation. My research seeks to resolve these uncertainties and critically evaluate whether BCEs could provide viable climate mitigation pathways through their expanded conservation and restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The course covers topics ranging from the GIS software and spatial data structures to the cartographic principles for mapping, metadata creation, and a variety of spatial analyses. Students also gain hands-on experience with applying concepts and tools introduces in the lectures using ArcGIS Pro.\r\nBiogeography (GEO4300) - Florida State University, Department of Geography - Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant\r\nThis is an undergraduate course focused on the distributions (including past, present, and increasingly, future distributions) of species and ecosystems across space and over time. The course is a lecture and topical reading-based course providing students with a foundation in biogeography, and also in various biogeographical concepts as they apply to contemporary issues such as land management, invasive species, and species conservation.\r\nMarine Invertebrates (SMS480) - University of Maine, School of Marine Sciences, Semester by the Sea program - Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant\r\nThis is an upper level undergraduate course within the Semester by the Sea program dealing with the general biology of coastal and deep-water marine benthic and pelagic invertebrates.The course involves weekly lectures on the functional morphology, behavior, ecology, phylogenetic relationships, life histories and role in human history of different marine invertebrate groups. Each lecture is paired with a field trip to local habitats surrounding the Darling Marine Center in Walpole, ME where students are able to collect and identify specimens using taxonomic keys.\r\nMarine Ecology (SMS352)- University of Maine, School of Marine Sciences, Semester by the Sea program - Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant\r\nThis is an upper level undergraduate course in the Semester by the Sea program providing an overview of the biotic interactions and physical forces structuring marine communities, the function and ecosystem services provided by marine communities, and the major threats to their continued function and value. Each week students hear a lecture and complete a field trip and/or experiment where they are able to make their own observations, develop and test their hypotheses, and link their findings to fundamental theories in ecology. Throughout the semester, students work on group projects based on the weekly field trips and/or laboratory experiments, focusing on the rocky intertidal habitats of the Gulf of Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nAbout Me\r\nI am a quantitative marine ecologist with research interests at the intersection of ecology, environmental change, society, and marine management. I combine novel field and lab approaches, spatial analyses, data synthesis, and statistical modeling to answer basic and applied questions about the changing structure, function, and ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems, including seagrasses, kelp forests, and tidal marshes. Broadly, my research seeks to understand the consequences of intensifying climate changes and spatial management decisions for nature and people. An emerging direction of my research also seeks to understand how better management of coastal ecosystems can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.\r\nI am most excited about solutions-oriented research, involving multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships with marine stakeholders. Much of my work involves researchers and management practitioners from government agencies (e.g., NOAA, DFO) and eNGOs.\r\nI am passionate about teaching and mentoring to prepare students for future careers as modern scientists, policymakers, and professionals. If you are interested in getting involved in my research, please research out!\r\nFinally, I am committed to fostering diverse, equitable, and inclusive research and learning environments in higher education.\r\nAffiliation\r\nI am an Ocean Climate Solutions postdoctoral fellow in the Baum Lab at the University of Victoria (UVic) working on a multi-institute collaboration called the Blue Carbon Canada project. Previously, I completed a dual MSc in marine biology and policy at the University of Maine’s Darling Marine Center supervised by Dr. Bob Steneck, followed by a PhD in geography at Florida State University) supervised by Dr. Sarah E. Lester. In between my MSc degrees and PhD, I worked as an affiliated researcher with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northeast Fisheries Science Center based at the J.J. Howard Marine Lab in Sandy Hook, NJ. Subsequently, I was as a lab manager and research technician with the Rasster Lab (the joint labs of Dr. Sarah Lester and Dr. Andrew Rassweiler at FSU.\r\nResearch Interests\r\nEcology and Biogeography\r\nGlobal Change Biology\r\nMarine Ecosystem Services\r\nConservation and Restoration Science\r\nOcean Climate Solutions\r\nContact Details\r\nEmail: jennmchenry@uvic.ca\r\nAddress: Department of Biology, University of Victoria, Cunningham Building 105a, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
