I combine\r\n            novel field and lab approaches, spatial analyses, data\r\n            synthesis, and statistical modeling to answer basic and\r\n            applied questions about the changing structure, function,\r\n            and societal benefits of coastal ecosystems that feature\r\n            marine foundation species (e.g., seagrasses and kelps).\r\n            Broadly, my research seeks to understand the consequences of\r\n            intensifying climate changes and natural resource management\r\n            decisions for nature and people. An emerging direction of my\r\n            research also seeks to understand how better management of\r\n            coastal ecosystems can contribute to climate mitigation and\r\n            adaptation efforts.\r\n            I am most excited about solutions-oriented research,\r\n            involving multidisciplinary collaborations and team science\r\n            approaches (e.g., working groups). Currently I am on the\r\n            leadership committee for the Subtidal\r\n            Kelp & Kelp Ecosystem Service Working Group for the\r\n            British Columbia - Washington Kelp Node. Additionally, I am\r\n            co-leading and co-organizing the new “Northwest Atlantic\r\n            Kelp on the Move Working Group” with Dr. Kira\r\n            Krumhansl from the Bedford Institute of\r\n            Oceanography.\r\n            I am passionate about teaching and mentoring to prepare\r\n            students for future careers as modern scientists,\r\n            policymakers, and professionals. If you are interested in\r\n            getting involved in my research, please reach out!\r\n            Finally, I am committed to fostering diverse, equitable,\r\n            and inclusive research and learning environments in higher\r\n            education.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Affiliation\r\n            I am an Ocean Climate Solutions postdoctoral fellow in\r\n            the Baum Lab at\r\n            the University of Victoria (UVic) working on a\r\n            multi-institute collaboration called the Blue Carbon Canada\r\n            project.

My research examines the effects of gradual climate changes (e.g., such as ocean warming and sea-level rise) on the geographic distributions of coastal marine species. Increasingly, I also consider the effects of extreme climatic events (e.g., marine heatwaves) and how climate-driven losses and redistribution of marine foundation species (e.g., seagrass beds and kelp forests) impacts the ecological structure and functions of coastal ecosystems. For this work, I tend to integrate statistical models, spatial analysis, and data synthesis approaches with observational data, ocean-climate forecasts, and high-performance computing.\r\n\r\nCoastal management scenarios to achieve ecological & societal co-benefits\r\nThe second major theme of my research examines the dynamic interactions between coastal ecosystems and people, with a particularly focus on the diverse ecological and societal benefits of marine foundation species. My research examines the biophysical drivers and spatial patterns of ecosystem service delivery and uses scenario modeling approaches to quantify the potential co-benefits of habitat conservation and restoration. Increasingly my research also explores how spatial planning and prioritization approaches can be implemented to ensure sustainable and equitable outcomes for nature and people under climate change.\r\n\r\nOceans as natural climate solutions\r\nAn emerging theme of my research addresses the potential for blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) to contribute natural climate solutions (NCS). Foundation habitats, such as seagrass beds, tidal marshes, and potentially kelp forests, are thought to play a globally significant role as natural reservoirs for organic and inorganic carbon. However, there is still considerable uncertainty in their estimated extents and relative rates of carbon accumulation. My research seeks to resolve these uncertainties and to critically evaluate whether BCEs could provide viable climate mitigation pathways through their expanded conservation and restoration.\r\n\r\nCurrent & Recently Completed Projects\r\nEvaluating the current and future capacity for natural climate solutions in Canada’s oceans.

The course covers the physical climate science (including climate forcings and impacts), and the state of knowledge concerning the suite of potential climate solutions available (including climate mitigation and adaption measures). The course is team-taught and employs a variety of active learning approaches, including student-led lessons and student-led discussions. Course content is guided by the sixth Intergovernmental on Climate Change Assessment Reports (i.e., IPCC AR6) and the latest peer reviewed literature.\r\nGeographic Information Systems lab (GIS4043L / GIS5101L) - Florida State University, Department of Geography - Role: Instructor\r\nThis is a computer-based course introducing the expanding field of geographic information, as a cross listed course open to undergraduate and graduate students. The course covers topics ranging from the GIS software and spatial data structures to the cartographic principles for mapping, metadata creation, and a variety of spatial analyses. Students also gain hands-on experience with applying concepts and tools introduces in the lectures using ArcGIS Pro.\r\nBiogeography (GEO4300) - Florida State University, Department of Geography - Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant\r\nThis is an undergraduate course focused on the distributions (including past, present, and increasingly, future distributions) of species and ecosystems across space and over time. The course is a lecture and topical reading-based course providing students with a foundation in biogeography, and also in various biogeographical concepts as they apply to contemporary issues such as land management, invasive species, and species conservation.\r\nMarine Invertebrates (SMS480) - University of Maine, School of Marine Sciences, Semester by the Sea program - Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant\r\nThis is an upper level undergraduate course within the Semester by the Sea program dealing with the general biology of coastal and deep-water marine benthic and pelagic invertebrates.The course involves weekly lectures on the functional morphology, behavior, ecology, phylogenetic relationships, life histories and role in human history of different marine invertebrate groups. Each lecture is paired with a field trip to local habitats surrounding the Darling Marine Center in Walpole, ME where students are able to collect and identify specimens using taxonomic keys.\r\nMarine Ecology (SMS352)- University of Maine, School of Marine Sciences, Semester by the Sea program - Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant\r\nThis is an upper level undergraduate course in the Semester by the Sea program providing an overview of the biotic interactions and physical forces structuring marine communities, the function and ecosystem services provided by marine communities, and the major threats to their continued function and value. Each week students hear a lecture and complete a field trip and/or experiment where they are able to make their own observations, develop and test their hypotheses, and link their findings to fundamental theories in ecology. Throughout the semester, students work on group projects based on the weekly field trips and/or laboratory experiments, focusing on the rocky intertidal habitats of the Gulf of Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nAbout Me\r\nI am a quantitative marine ecologist with research interests at the intersection of ecology, environmental change, society, and marine management. I combine novel field and lab approaches, spatial analyses, data synthesis, and statistical modeling to answer basic and applied questions about the changing structure, function, and ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems, including seagrasses, kelp forests, and tidal marshes. Broadly, my research seeks to understand the consequences of intensifying climate changes and spatial management decisions for nature and people. An emerging direction of my research also seeks to understand how better management of coastal ecosystems can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.\r\nI am most excited about solutions-oriented research, involving multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships with marine stakeholders. Much of my work involves researchers and management practitioners from government agencies (e.g., NOAA, DFO) and eNGOs.\r\nI am passionate about teaching and mentoring to prepare students for future careers as modern scientists, policymakers, and professionals. If you are interested in getting involved in my research, please research out!\r\nFinally, I am committed to fostering diverse, equitable, and inclusive research and learning environments in higher education.\r\nAffiliation\r\nI am an Ocean Climate Solutions postdoctoral fellow in the Baum Lab at the University of Victoria (UVic) working on a multi-institute collaboration called the Blue Carbon Canada project.
