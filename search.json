I approach my research with the aim of advancing ecological theory and informing spatial management decisions, related to habitat conservation and restoration, ocean planning, and sustainable fisheries. Currently, I am completing a PhD in geography in the Rasster Lab (the joint labs of Dr. Sarah E. Lester and Dr. Andrew Rassweiler at Florida State University). My work combines novel field and laboratory approaches, data synthesis, modeling, and geographic information systems (GIS). Scientific collaboration, partnerships with marine stakeholders, and mentorship of undergraduate trainees are all important facets of my work.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            CV\r\n            PhD in Geography (Expected 2022), Florida State University\r\n            Dual MSc in Marine Biology and Marine Policy (2014), University of Maine\r\n            BSc in Marine Science (2010), University of Maine\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Research Interests\r\n            Ecology and Biogeography\r\n            Global Change Biology\r\n            Marine Ecosystem Services\r\n            Conservation and Restoration Science\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Contact Information\r\n            113 Collegiate Loop Bellamy Building, Room 307 PO Box 3062190 Tallahassee, FL, 32306\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Jennifer McHenry\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Twitter\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                       Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              Bio\r\n              I am a quantitative geographer interested in a range of interdisciplinary research questions related to the macroecology, global change, and ecosystem services provided by coastal marine ecosystems.
