I combine novel field and lab approaches, geospatial analyses, open data synthesis, and forecast modeling to answer questions. Broadly, my research seeks to understand the consequences of intensifying climate changes and spatial management decisions for the structure, ecological function, and ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems, including seagrasses and temperate reefs. An emerging direction of my research also seeks to understand how better management of coastal ecosystems can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.\r\n            I am most excited about applied and solutions-oriented research, involving multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships with marine stakeholders. Much of my work involves researchers and management practitioners from government agencies (e.g., NOAA, DFO) and eNGOs.\r\n            I am passionate about teaching and mentoring to prepare students for future careers as modern scientists, policymakers, and professionals.

During my PhD, I examined the need to account for multiple environmental variables when projecting marine species range shifts in response to ocean warming. I also examined the potential for climate change to disrupt key ecological interactions, like the critical role that tropical seagrass beds play in enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nMarine Ecosystem Service Delivery in a Changing World\r\nThe second major theme of my research seeks to understand and predict the ecosystem service outcomes of habitat conservation and restoration decisions. My dissertation research examined the capacity of seagrasses in the Florida Gulf Coast to provide multiple ecosystem services, evaluating spatial patterns of service co-variation and exploring the potential for co-benefits and trade-offs from management.\r\n\r\nOcean Climate Solutions\r\nAn emerging theme of my research seeks to evaluate how blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) can contribute to the development of ocean climate solutions. As part of a new multi-institute collaboration (Blue Carbon Canada), my postdoc research will address critical research gaps concerning the current and future mitigation potential of Canada’s BCEs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The course covers topics ranging from the GIS software and spatial data structures to the cartographic principles for mapping, metadata creation, and a variety of spatial analyses. Students also gain hands-on experience with applying concepts and tools introduces in the lectures using ArcGIS Pro.\r\nBiogeography (GEO4300) - Florida State University, Department of Geography - Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant\r\nThis is an undergraduate course focused on the distributions (including past, present, and increasingly, future distributions) of species and ecosystems across space and over time. The course is a lecture and topical reading-based course providing students with a foundation in biogeography, and also in various biogeographical concepts as they apply to contemporary issues such as land management, invasive species, and species conservation.\r\nMarine Invertebrates (SMS480) - University of Maine, School of Marine Sciences, Semester by the Sea program - Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant\r\nThis is an upper level undergraduate course within the Semester by the Sea program dealing with the general biology of coastal and deep-water marine benthic and pelagic invertebrates.The course involves weekly lectures on the functional morphology, behavior, ecology, phylogenetic relationships, life histories and role in human history of different marine invertebrate groups. Each lecture is paired with a field trip to local habitats surrounding the Darling Marine Center in Walpole, ME where students are able to collect and identify specimens using taxonomic keys.\r\nMarine Ecology (SMS352)- University of Maine, School of Marine Sciences, Semester by the Sea program - Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant\r\nThis is an upper level undergraduate course in the Semester by the Sea program providing an overview of the biotic interactions and physical forces structuring marine communities, the function and ecosystem services provided by marine communities, and the major threats to their continued function and value. Each week students hear a lecture and complete a field trip and/or experiment where they are able to make their own observations, develop and test their hypotheses, and link their findings to fundamental theories in ecology. Throughout the semester, students work on group projects based on the weekly field trips and/or laboratory experiments, focusing on the rocky intertidal habitats of the Gulf of Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
