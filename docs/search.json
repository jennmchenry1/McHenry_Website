      "description": "I am a quantitive geographer interested in a range of interdisciplinary questions related to the macroecology, global change, and ecosystem services provided by coastal marine ecosystems. My research is motivated by the dual goal of advancing ecological theory and informing spatial managment decisions, related to habitat consevation and restoration. Currently, I am completng a PhD in geography at Florida State University. My work combines novel field and laboratory approaches, data synthesis, modeling, and geographic information systems (GIS). Scientific collaboration, partnerships with marine stakeholders, and mentorship of undergraduate trainees are all important facets of my work. \n",
