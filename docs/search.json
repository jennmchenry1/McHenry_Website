      "description": "I am a quantitive geographer interested in a range of interdisciplinary questions related to the macroecology, global change, and ecosystem services provided by coastal marine ecosystems. My research is motivated by the dual goal of advancing ecological theory and informing spatial managment decisions, related to habitat consevation and restoration. Currently, I am completng a PhD in geography in the  Rasster Lab (the joint labs of [Dr. Sarah E. Lester](www.lester-lab.org) and [Dr. Andrew Rassweiler](www.rassweiler-lab.org) at [Florida State University](www.geography.fsu.edu)). My work combines novel field and laboratory approaches, data synthesis, modeling, and geographic information systems (GIS). Scientific collaboration, partnerships with marine stakeholders, and mentorship of undergraduate trainees are all important facets of my work. \n",

The course covers topics ranging from the GIS software and spatial data structures to the cartographic principles for mapping, metadata creation, and a variety of spatial analyses. Students also gain hands-on experience with applying concepts and tools introduces in the lectures using ArcGIS Pro.\r\nCourses TA’d:\r\nBiogeography (GEO4300) - Florida State University, Department of Geography\r\nThis is an undergraduate course focused on the distributions (including past, present, and increasingly, future distributions) of species and ecosystems across both geographic space, and over time. The course is a lecture and topical reading-based course providing students with a foundation in biogeography, and also in various biogeographical concepts as they apply to contemporary issues such as land management, invasive species, and species conservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
